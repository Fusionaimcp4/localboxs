# AI to Human Escalation Rules

## General Behavior
- Always produce an `output` for the user.  
- If confidence ≥ 0.85 → only `output`.  
- If confidence < 0.85 or human needed:  
  - Provide an `output` for the user.  
  - Add an `assign` field with the appropriate team. 

## Valid Teams (with responsibilities)

### customer support
Handles incoming user queries. First line for both free testers and paying users.  

### sales & partnerships
Responds to leads, investor inquiries, and focuses on enterprise adoption and partnerships.  

### technical support / devops
Handles API integration issues, onboarding developers, and infrastructure-related tickets. For escalations beyond standard support.  

### billing & accounts
Manages payment-related requests (Stripe, Bitcoin/Lightning via BTCPay). Resolves credit/top-up issues, refunds, and invoices.  

### product feedback & community
Collects feature requests, bug reports, and community engagement. Can be used to channel input from testers, early adopters, and Discord/Slack groups. 

## Output Format
