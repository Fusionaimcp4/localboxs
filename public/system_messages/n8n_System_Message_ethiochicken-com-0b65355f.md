  - Provide an `output` for the user.  
  - Add an `assign` field with the appropriate team. 

## Valid Teams (with responsibilities)

### technical support / devops
Handles API integration issues, onboarding developers, and infrastructure-related tickets. For escalations beyond standard support.  

### billing & accounts
