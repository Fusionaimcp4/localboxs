# System Message Improvements - Complete

## ✅ **Changes Implemented**

### **1. Fixed ${businessName} Placeholder Replacement**

**Problem:**
- Template contains `${businessName}` placeholder
- It was never being replaced with actual business name
- System messages had literal `${businessName}` text

**Solution:**
Added replacement in 3 places:

#### **A. Demo Creation (New KB Generation)**
**File:** `app/api/demo/create/route.ts` (Line 177-178)
```typescript
// Step 4.5: Replace ${businessName} placeholder with actual business name
finalSystemMessage = finalSystemMessage.replace(/\$\{businessName\}/g, businessName);
```

#### **B. Demo Creation (Reusing Preview File)**
**File:** `app/api/demo/create/route.ts` (Line 148-149)
```typescript
// Replace ${businessName} placeholder even in reused files
finalSystemMessage = finalSystemMessage.replace(/\$\{businessName\}/g, businessName);
```

#### **C. System Message Updates (Dashboard Edits)**
**File:** `app/api/dashboard/system-messages/[messageId]/route.ts` (Line 58-59)
```typescript
// Replace ${businessName} placeholder with actual business name
const processedContent = content.replace(/\$\{businessName\}/g, systemMessage.demo.businessName);
```

**Result:**
- All system messages now show actual business names
- Works for new demos, reused previews, and manual edits
- Template remains clean with placeholder

### **2. Added RAG Instructions (Optional/Conditional Use)**

**Requirements:**
- ✅ RAG should be SECONDARY to system message KB
- ✅ Must work without RAG (for demos/unregistered users)
- ✅ Instructions always present but harmless if tool unavailable
- ✅ Clear priority hierarchy

**Solution:**
Added new section to template after Knowledge Base section.

**File:** `data/templates/n8n_System_Message.md` (Lines 32-45)

```markdown
## Using Additional Resources

**If the Knowledge Base section above doesn't contain the answer to the user's question:**

1. **First:** Check if you have access to the "Retrieve Knowledge Base Context" tool
2. **If available:** Use it to search through uploaded documents and files
3. **If unavailable or no results:** Politely inform the user you don't have that specific information

**Priority Order:**
- **Primary Source:** Use the Knowledge Base section above
- **Secondary Source:** Use the "Retrieve Knowledge Base Context" tool (if available)
- **Fallback:** Escalate to human support or admit you don't have the information

**Important:** The RAG tool may not always be available. If it's not accessible, simply rely on the Knowledge Base section above.
```

**Why This Approach Works:**

1. **Always Present:**
   - Instructions are in template for all system messages
   - No conditional logic needed in code
   - Consistent structure for all users

2. **Graceful Degradation:**
   - If RAG tool exists → AI uses it (secondary source)
   - If RAG tool doesn't exist → AI ignores instruction, no error
   - Works perfectly for demos without accounts

3. **Clear Priority:**
   - Step 1: Check system message KB (primary)
   - Step 2: Use RAG tool if available (secondary)
   - Step 3: Escalate or admit lack of knowledge (fallback)

4. **No Breaking Changes:**
   - Existing demos continue to work
   - New demos get RAG capability
   - Template structure unchanged

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Scenario A: Demo User (No Account, No RAG)**
```
User asks: "What are your hours?"

AI Process:
1. ✅ Checks Knowledge Base section → Finds hours → Answers
   OR
2. ✅ Checks Knowledge Base section → No hours found
3. ✅ Sees "Retrieve Knowledge Base Context" instruction
4. ❌ Tool not available (no RAG for demos)
5. ✅ Admits: "I don't have that specific information"

Result: Works perfectly, no errors
```

### **Scenario B: Registered User (With KB Linked)**
```
User asks: "What is the price of item X?"

AI Process:
1. ✅ Checks Knowledge Base section (system message) → Not found
2. ✅ Sees "Retrieve Knowledge Base Context" instruction
3. ✅ Tool available → Calls RAG API
4. ✅ RAG returns relevant chunk from uploaded PDF
5. ✅ Answers: "Item X costs $5.00"

Result: RAG used as secondary source
```

### **Scenario C: Info in Both Places**
```
User asks: "What is your company address?"

AI Process:
1. ✅ Checks Knowledge Base section (system message) → Found!
2. ✅ Answers directly from system message
3. ❌ Never needs to call RAG tool (priority respected)

Result: Efficient, uses primary source first
```

## 📊 **Impact Summary**

### **Before Changes:**

❌ System messages had literal `${businessName}` text
❌ No RAG instructions (RAG never used even when available)
❌ RAG tool existed but AI didn't know how to use it

### **After Changes:**

✅ System messages show actual business names
✅ RAG tool is used when needed (as secondary source)
✅ Works with and without RAG (demos, registered users)
✅ Clear priority: System message → RAG → Escalate
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Create new demo → Verify business name appears (not `${businessName}`)
- [ ] Edit existing system message in dashboard → Verify name replacement
- [ ] Test demo user (no account) → Verify no RAG errors
- [ ] Test registered user with KB → Verify RAG is used for questions not in system message
- [ ] Test registered user with KB → Verify system message KB is used first (priority)
- [ ] Check n8n workflow → Verify system message has business name

## 🔄 **Migration Notes**

**For Existing System Messages:**
- They will continue to work as-is
- Next time they're edited in dashboard, `${businessName}` will be replaced
- Or manually regenerate to get new RAG instructions

**For New Demos:**
- Automatically include RAG instructions
- Business name automatically replaced
- Ready for RAG immediately (when KB is linked)

---

## 📝 **Files Modified**

1. ✅ `data/templates/n8n_System_Message.md` - Added RAG instructions section
2. ✅ `app/api/demo/create/route.ts` - Added businessName replacement (2 places)
3. ✅ `app/api/dashboard/system-messages/[messageId]/route.ts` - Added businessName replacement

**No database changes required!** ✅

## 🎉 **Benefits**

1. **Cleaner System Messages:** Real business names instead of placeholders
2. **Smart RAG Usage:** Secondary source, not primary
3. **Flexible:** Works with or without RAG
4. **User-Friendly:** Clear instructions for AI behavior
5. **Future-Proof:** Easy to extend or modify
6. **No Breaking Changes:** All existing functionality preserved
