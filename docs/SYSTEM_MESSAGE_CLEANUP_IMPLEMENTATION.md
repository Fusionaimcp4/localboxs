# System Message Cleanup - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ **Changes Implemented**

### **Problem:**
Generated system messages included many empty or "Unknown"-filled sections that added no value:
```markdown
## Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Unknown.
- **Backend:** Unknown.
- **DB:** Unknown.
...

## Governance & Security
- **Auth:** Unknown.
- **Data handling:** Unknown.
- **Backups:** Unknown.
```

These sections:
- ‚ùå Cluttered the system message
- ‚ùå Wasted AI context window
- ‚ùå Provided no actionable information
- ‚ùå Made messages harder to read

---

## üîß **Solution: Two-Layer Approach**

### **Layer 1: Improved LLM Prompt** ‚úÖ

**File:** `lib/llm.ts` (Lines 12-35)

**What Changed:**
Added explicit instructions to GPT-4o-mini to SKIP sections without real data:

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You produce a precise Business Knowledge Base in Markdown from website content.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Only include sections that contain REAL, SPECIFIC information
- Skip ENTIRE sections where all fields are "Unknown", "N/A", or cannot be determined
- Quality over completeness - better to omit than to fill with "Unknown"
- Focus on actionable, useful information

Available Sections (only include if you have real data):
- Project Overview - ALWAYS include this
- Key Features & Functionality - Only if specific features found
- Architecture & Tech Stack - SKIP if all Unknown
- User Journey - Only if you can infer specific steps
- Operations & Processes - Only if mentioned on website
- Governance & Security - SKIP if all Unknown
- FAQs & Troubleshooting - ALWAYS include if you find any Q&As
- Glossary - Only include terms actually mentioned/needed

Examples of what to SKIP:
- "Frontend: Unknown" - Just omit the entire Architecture section
- "Auth: Unknown, Data handling: Unknown" - Skip Governance section entirely
- Generic user journeys with no specific details
`;
```

**Result:**
GPT-4o-mini will now naturally avoid creating empty sections.

### **Layer 2: Post-Processing Cleanup** ‚úÖ

**File:** `lib/llm.ts` (Lines 7-51)

**What It Does:**
Automatically removes any remaining empty sections that GPT might still include.

**Function:** `cleanEmptySections(kbMarkdown: string)`

**Detection Logic:**
A section is removed if it matches ANY of these criteria:

1. **Only "Unknown" values:**
   ```markdown
   ## Section Name
   - Unknown
   ```

2. **Multiple "Unknown" in short content:**
   ```markdown
   ## Section Name
   - Unknown
   - Unknown  
   - Unknown
   ```
   (3+ "Unknown" in < 200 characters)

3. **Effectively empty:**
   ```markdown
   ## Section Name
   
   ```
   (< 10 characters of content)

4. **Bullet points with Unknown:**
   ```markdown
   ## Section Name
   - Unknown
   - Unknown
   ```

**Console Output:**
```
üóëÔ∏è Removing empty section: "Architecture & Tech Stack"
üóëÔ∏è Removing empty section: "Governance & Security"
```

**Integration:**
Cleaning happens automatically after LLM generation:

```typescript
const content = completion.choices[0]?.message?.content;
const cleanedContent = cleanEmptySections(content);  // ‚Üê Automatic cleanup
return cleanedContent;
```

## üîç **How It Works**

### **Flow:**

```
1. User creates demo
    ‚Üì
2. Scrape website content
    ‚Üì
3. Send to GPT-4o-mini with improved prompt
    ‚Üì
4. GPT generates KB (skips many empty sections)
    ‚Üì
5. cleanEmptySections() runs
    ‚Üì
6. Removes any remaining "Unknown" sections
    ‚Üì
7. Clean, focused KB returned
    ‚Üì
8. Merged into system message template
```

### **Detection Example:**

**Input to cleanEmptySections:**
```markdown
## Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Unknown.
- **Backend:** Unknown.
- **DB:** Unknown.

## FAQs & Troubleshooting
1. What are your hours? - 5pm-10pm
```

**Process:**
1. Split by `## ` ‚Üí 2 sections
2. Section 1: "Architecture & Tech Stack"
   - Content: "- **Frontend:** Unknown.\n- **Backend:** Unknown.\n- **DB:** Unknown."
   - Check: Has 3+ "Unknown" in < 200 chars ‚Üí **REMOVE**
3. Section 2: "FAQs & Troubleshooting"
   - Content: "1. What are your hours? - 5pm-10pm"
   - Check: Has real data ‚Üí **KEEP**

**Output:**
```markdown
## FAQs & Troubleshooting
1. What are your hours? - 5pm-10pm
```
