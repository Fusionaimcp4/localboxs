# CRM Integration - Implementation Checklist

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

All code has been written, tested, and is ready for deployment. Follow these steps to activate the CRM Integration feature.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Generate Encryption Key ⚠️ CRITICAL

```bash
npm run generate-encryption-key
```

**Output will look like:**
```
🔐 Generating Integration Encryption Key

Add this to your .env file:

INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6...

⚠️  Keep this key secure and never commit it to version control!
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Add the generated key to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Add this line (REQUIRED)
INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-key-here

# These are now optional (fallback only)
CHATWOOT_BASE_URL=https://chatwoot.mcp4.ai
CHATWOOT_ACCOUNT_ID=1
CHATWOOT_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### 3. Run Database Migration

The `Integration` model is already in your schema. Apply it:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_integrations
```

Or if you've already migrated:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 4. Build & Test

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or start production
npm run start
```

## ✅ Post-Deployment Testing

### Test 1: Access Integration Page
1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/integrations`
3. ✅ Page loads without errors

### Test 2: Add Chatwoot Integration
1. Click "Add Integration"
2. Select "CRM Integration"
3. Choose "Chatwoot"
4. Fill in your credentials:
   - **Integration Name**: "My Chatwoot"
   - **Base URL**: Your Chatwoot URL
   - **Account ID**: Your account ID
   - **API Token**: Your API token
5. Click "Test Connection"
6. ✅ Should show: "Successfully connected to Chatwoot"

### Test 3: Save Integration
1. After successful test, click "Save Integration"
2. ✅ Should redirect to integration list
3. ✅ Your integration should appear as "ACTIVE"

### Test 4: Create Demo with User Credentials
1. Go to Dashboard → Demos
2. Click "Create New Demo"
3. Enter demo details
4. ✅ Demo should be created using YOUR Chatwoot credentials
5. ✅ Inbox should be created in YOUR Chatwoot account

### Test 5: Verify Database Encryption
1. Connect to your database
2. Run: `SELECT * FROM "Integration" LIMIT 1;`
3. ✅ The `configuration` field should contain encrypted data like:
   ```json
   {
     "provider": "CHATWOOT",
     "baseUrl": "https://...",
     "accountId": "123",
     "apiKey": "a1b2c3:d4e5f6:g7h8i9..."
   }
   ```
4. ✅ Notice the `apiKey` contains colons (encrypted format)

### Test 6: Edit Integration
1. Click "Configure" on your integration
2. Change the name
3. Click "Update Integration"
4. ✅ Should save successfully

### Test 7: Deactivate/Activate
1. Click "Deactivate" on your integration
2. ✅ Status should change to "INACTIVE"
3. Click "Activate"
4. ✅ Status should change to "ACTIVE"

### Test 8: Delete Integration
1. Create a test integration
2. Click "Remove"
3. Confirm deletion
4. ✅ Integration should be removed

### Test 9: Backward Compatibility
1. Remove your user CRM integration (or test with a fresh user)
2. Create a demo
3. ✅ Should still work using environment variables as fallback

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable is required"
**Solution**: 
```bash
npm run generate-encryption-key
# Add output to .env
```

### Issue: "Missing Chatwoot credentials"
**Solution**: Either:
- Add CRM integration in dashboard, OR
- Set environment variables in .env

### Issue: Database migration fails
**Solution**:
```bash
# Reset migrations (DEV ONLY!)
npx prisma migrate reset

# Then migrate again
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Issue: Connection test fails
**Solutions**:
1. Verify Chatwoot Base URL (include https://)
2. Check Account ID is correct
3. Regenerate API token in Chatwoot
4. Check network/firewall settings

### Issue: Encryption errors after update
**Solution**: The system detects encrypted data automatically. If you see encryption errors:
1. Delete the integration
2. Create a new one with fresh credentials

## 📊 What's New for Users
